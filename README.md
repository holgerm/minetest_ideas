## Viticulture

Lead your own winery to success. Buy land, cultivate vines, do the harvest, buy machines for your winery etc. and finally produce wines and sell them successfully. There are plenty of options that one could realize for that game, but I'll try to focus on the most important ones at first.

The main tasks we have to solve:

- Create a wine region as world
- Money, bank account
- Buy, own, sell and rent land
- Let vines grow dependant on weather, expositon, soil etc. (start simple, but have extensibility in mind)
- Harvest
- Proceed the grapes in the cellar (diverse options for vinification; again: start simple, but have extensibility in mind)
- Sell the wine (could be very simple at first)
